(‘NN Group’) on \\nSolvency II as required by the Solvency II legislation. NN Group already discloses most of the information that is required to be included in the \\nSFCR in its 2018 Annual Report (‘Annual Report’). In order to ensure the most transparent and user-friendly approach, the information that is \\nalready included in the Annual Report (including the Consolidated annual accounts, the Annual review and the Financial Report) is not \\nduplicated in this SFCR. Therefore, this SFCR is prepared as a supplement to NN Group’s Annual Report. It includes all information required to be \\ndisclosed in the SFCR, either through a specific reference to the Annual Report or as supplemental information. \\n\\nAs required by the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35/Annex XX ‘Structure of the Solvency and Financial Condition Report and Regular \\nSupervisory Report’, this SFCR follows the required standard chapter layout. The subjects addressed are based on Directive 2009/138/EC/ and \\n(amended) Directive 2014/51/EU section 3 – Public Disclosures (articles 51-56), Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 and (amended) Delegated \\nRegulation (EU) 2016/467 chapter XII Public Disclosures (articles 292-298). \\n\\nNN Group is required to submit the so-called Quantitative Reporting Templates (‘QRTs’) to its supervisor Dutch Central Bank (‘DNB’). A subset \\nof these QRTs, which are required to be publicly disclosed and which provide quantitative information in accordance with Solvency II as at 31 \\nDecember 2018, are included in the appendix to this SFCR. \\n\\nThe amounts disclosed in this SFCR are, consistent with the amounts in the Annual Report, in millions of euros unless stated otherwise. To \\ncomply with the Solvency II legislation, the amounts in the QRTs are in thousands of euros. \\n\\nThe Solvency ratio, as well as the amounts disclosed in this SFCR are not final until filed with the regulators. \\n\\nChapter A ‘Business and performance’ describes the overall business profile and structure of NN Group. It also provides insight into the \\nunderwriting and investment performance of NN Group. Chapter B ‘Governance system’ explains the organisational governance structure and \\nlooks into the role and execution of key Solvency II functions. Chapter C ‘Risk profile’ analyses NN Group’s exposure to financial and non-\\nfinancial risks and explains the risk mitigation techniques in place. Chapter D ‘Valuation for group solvency purposes’ elaborates on the \\ndifferences in presentation and measurement of balance sheet elements between Solvency II and International Financial Reporting Standards \\n(‘IFRS’). Chapter E ‘Capital management’ discusses the composition of Available and Eligible Own Funds and the calculation of the Solvency \\nCapital Requirement (‘SCR’). \\n\\nMaterial changes in 2018 \\nOn 5 December 2018, NN Group announced that it received approval from DNB to expand its Partial Internal Model under Solvency II to include \\nthe Delta Lloyd Life and Non-life entities in the Netherlands. The expanded approved Partial Internal Model is used to calculate regulatory \\ncapital requirements effective 31 December 2018. \\n\\nOn 13 December 2018, NN Group announced that it had obtained approval from DNB to execute the legal mergers of Delta Lloyd \\nLevensverzekering N.V. (Delta Lloyd Life) into Nationale-Nederlanden Levensverzekering Maatschappij N.V. (NN Life) and Delta Lloyd \\nSchadeverzekering N.V. (Delta Lloyd Non-life) into Nationale-Nederlanden Schadeverzekering Maatschappij N.V. (NN Non-life). The legal \\nmergers became effective on 1 January 2019. As a result, NN Non-life assumed all assets and liabilities of Delta Lloyd Non-life, and NN Life \\nassumed all assets and liabilities of Delta Lloyd Life, including its subordinated notes of EUR 500 million. These legal mergers had no impact in \\n2018. \\n\\nOn 16 August 2018 NN Group announced that it had reached an agreement to acquire Aegon’s Life Insurance business in the Czech Republic \\nand Aegon’s Life Insurance and Pension businesses in Slovakia for a total consideration of EUR 155 million. The transaction was completed in \\nJanuary 2019. The transaction was funded from existing cash resources and does not have a material impact on the operating result and the \\nSolvency II ratio of NN Group. These acquisitions had no impact in 2018. \\n\\nEligible Own Funds \\nSolvency II requires to hold Eligible Own Funds for covering the Solvency Capital Requirement. The Eligible Own Funds are classified in three \\ntiers depending on whether the own fund items are available to absorb losses on a going concern basis and/or in the case of winding-up as \\nprescribed in the Solvency II Legislation. Tier 1 Own Funds items are the highest grade capital and Tier 3 Own Funds are the lowest grade \\ncapital. \\n\\nEligible Own Funds \\nIn EUR million \\nTier 1 (restricted and unrestricted) \\nTier 2  \\nTier 3 \\nTotal Eligible Own Funds \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n2018 \\n13,539 \\n2,433 \\n755 \\n16,727 \\n \\n\\n2017 \\n11,907 \\n2,420 \\n1,085 \\n15,412 \\n \\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\nB  C  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nSummary continued \\n \\n\\nEligible Own Funds increased by EUR 1.3 billion from EUR 15.4 billion at 31 December 2017 to EUR 16.7 billion at 31 December 2018 mainly due to \\noperating capital generation and market variances, partially offset by capital flows to shareholders reflecting the 2018 interim and final dividend \\nand the impact related to the repurchase of the warrants from ING Groep N.V. Market variances reflect the favourable impact of movements in \\ncredit spreads as well as positive real estate revaluations, partly offset by negative equity revaluations. \\n\\nImpact of long term guarantees and transitional measures \\nThe quantification of the impact of a change to zero of the volatility adjustment, the transitional measures on technical provisions and the \\ntransitional measures on interest rates on NN Group\\'s Solvency capital ratio - represented by an adjustment on the amount of technical \\nprovisions, the SCR, the Basic Own Funds and the Eligible Own Funds, is included in the paragraph ‘Matching and volatility adjustment, \\ntransitional measures and transitional risk-free interest rate term structure’ on page 26 in Section D.2 and QRT S.22.01.22 ‘Impact of long term \\nguarantees and transitional measures’ in the Appendix. \\n\\nSolvency Capital Requirement \\nAs at 31 December 2018, the SCR is based on NN Group’s Partial Internal Model for the Dutch insurance entities (NN Life, NN Non-life, Delta \\nLloyd Life, Delta Lloyd Non-life, NN Re and Movir) and the Standard Formula for ABN AMRO Life, ABN AMRO Non-life and international \\ninsurance entities of NN Group. \\n\\nSolvency Capital Requirement \\nIn EUR million \\nMarket Risk \\nCounterparty Default Risk \\nNon-Market Risk \\nTotal BSCR (before diversification) \\n \\nDiversification \\nTotal BSCR (after diversification) \\n \\nOperational Risk \\nLACDT \\nOther \\nSolvency II entities SCR \\n \\nNon Solvency II entities \\nTotal SCR \\n \\nThe Solvency Capital Requirement decreased by EUR 0.4 billion, from EUR 7.7 billion at 31 December 2017 to EUR 7.3 billion at 31 December \\n2018. The decrease is mainly driven by operating capital generation and market variances reflecting the favourable impact from credit spread \\nmovements partly offset by a decrease of interest rates. The negative impact from the decrease of the Dutch corporate tax rate is largely offset \\nby the positive impact of the expansion of the Partial Internal Model to the main Delta Lloyd entities in the Netherlands. \\n\\n2018 \\n4,055 \\n274 \\n5,883 \\n10,212 \\n \\n-2,638 \\n7,574 \\n \\n659 \\n-1,456 \\n-10 \\n6,767 \\n \\n507 \\n7,274 \\n \\n\\n2017 \\n5,215 \\n667 \\n5,649 \\n11,531 \\n \\n-3,208 \\n8,323 \\n \\n677 \\n-1,788 \\n18 \\n7,230 \\n \\n501 \\n7,731 \\n \\n\\nNN Group’s Solvency II ratio \\nThe Solvency II ratio of NN Group increased to 230% at the end of 2018 from 199% at the end of 2017. The increase is driven by operating \\ncapital generation and market variances, partly offset by capital flows to shareholders. Market variances contributed positively to the ratio \\nreflecting the favourable impact of movements in credit spreads as well as positive real estate revaluations, partly offset by negative equity \\nrevaluations and movements in interest rates. Capital flows to shareholders reflect the 2018 interim and final dividend and the impact related to \\nthe repurchase of the warrants from ING Groep N.V. The negative impact from the decrease of the Dutch corporate tax rate is mainly offset by \\nthe positive impact of the expansion of the Partial Internal Model. \\n\\nThe following table presents the solvency ratio of NN Group at year-end 2018 (and reported at year-end 2017): \\n\\nSolvency ratio \\nIn EUR million \\nEligible Own Funds (EOF) \\nMinimum Capital Requirement (MCR) \\nSolvency Capital Requirement (SCR)  \\nSurplus \\nRatio (%) (EOF/SCR) \\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n2018 \\n16,727 \\n3,357 \\n7,274 \\n9,453 \\n230% \\n \\n\\n2017 \\n15,412 \\n3,442 \\n7,731 \\n7,681 \\n199% \\n \\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\nBusiness and \\nperformance \\n\\nB  C  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nBusiness and performance \\n \\n\\nA.

The Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group comprise the accounts of NN \\nGroup N.V. and all entities over which NN Group has control. NN Group has control over an entity when NN Group is exposed to, or has rights to, \\nvariable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The assessment \\nof control is based on the substance of the relationship between NN Group and the entity and considers existing and potential voting rights that \\nare substantive. For a right to be substantive, the holder must have the practical ability to exercise that right. \\n\\nFor interests in investment entities, the existence of control is determined taking into account both NN Group’s financial interests for own risk \\nand its role as asset manager. Financial interests for risk of policyholders are not taken into account when the policyholders decide on the \\ninvestment allocations of their insurance policies (i.e. the policyholder has the ‘power’) and assume all risks and benefits of these investments (i.e. \\nthe policyholder assumes the variable returns). \\n\\nThe results of the operations and the net assets of subsidiaries are included in the profit and loss account and the balance sheet from the date \\ncontrol is obtained until the date control is lost. Minority interests are initially measured at their proportionate share of the subsidiaries’ \\nidentifiable net assets at the date of acquisition. On disposal, the difference between the sales proceeds, net of directly attributable transaction \\ncosts, and the net assets is included in net result. \\n\\nA subsidiary which NN Group has agreed to sell but is still legally owned by NN Group may still be controlled by NN Group at the balance sheet \\ndate and, therefore, still be included in the consolidation. Such a subsidiary may be presented as held for sale if certain conditions are met. \\n\\nAll intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Where \\nnecessary, the accounting policies used by subsidiaries are changed to ensure consistency with NN Group policies. In general, the reporting \\ndates of subsidiaries are the same as the reporting date of NN Group N.V. \\n\\nA list of principal subsidiaries is included in Note 31 ‘Principal subsidiaries and geographical information’. \\n\\nNN Group owns 51% of the shares of Nationale-Nederlanden ABN AMRO Verzekeringen Holding B.V. (Nationale-Nederlanden ABN AMRO \\nVerzekeringen). Nationale-Nederlanden ABN AMRO Verzekeringen is fully consolidated by NN Group, with a minority interest recognised of \\n49%. At 31 December 2018, the minority interest relating to Nationale-Nederlanden ABN AMRO Verzekeringen recognised in equity was \\nEUR 222 million (2017: EUR 302 million) (further reference is made to chapter E and Note 12 ‘Equity’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts). \\n\\nBasis of consolidation for Solvency II reporting \\nFor Solvency II reporting, NN Group makes a distinction in the treatment of the following groups of entities: \\n∙ Solvency II entities: These are all life, non-life and reinsurance entities and their direct insurance participations that are located within the \\n\\nEuropean Economic Area (‘EEA’). These entities are subject to the Solvency II legislation for both Solo and Group reporting. The \\naccounting and consolidation-based method, similar to the IFRS consolidation method, is used to consolidate Solvency II entities over \\nwhich NN Group has control. Solvency II entities are consolidated line-by-line in the Solvency II balance sheet whereas intra-group \\ntransactions between Solvency II entities have been eliminated. \\n\\n∙ Non-Solvency II entities are entities controlled by NN Group that are other financial sector entities or are (re)insurance entities outside the \\n\\nEEA. These entities are not consolidated in the Solvency II balance sheet, but recognised as participations in the Solvency II Balance \\nSheet of NN Group. Intercompany transactions with Non-Solvency II entities are not eliminated. Their participation value and their \\ncontribution to the Group capital requirement are based on local sectoral rules. NN Group recognises the following types of non-Solvency \\nII entities: \\n-  Other financial sector entities, including Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision: pension funds in Central Europe, NN Investment \\n\\nPartners and NN Bank. NN Group is designated by DNB as a mixed financial holding company, also known as a Financial Conglomerate. \\nTherefore, NN Bank is only taken into account as an associate in the Solvency II balance sheet and excluded from NN Group’s Own Funds \\nand SCR. \\n\\n-  Non-EEA insurance entities on equivalence basis: NN Group makes use of the deduction and aggregation (‘D&A’) method for NN Life \\n\\nJapan, following the granting of provisional equivalence of Japan by the European Commission. \\n\\n \\nNationale-Nederlanden ABN AMRO Verzekeringen, which is 51% owned by NN Group, is fully consolidated in the Solvency II balance sheet and \\n100% included in both Basic Own Funds and the SCR. The 49% minority interest in the excess of Own Funds over the SCR is excluded from the \\nEligible Own Funds of NN Group as required by the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35/article 330 (4) and Guideline 14 ‘Treatment of minority \\ninterests for covering the group solvency capital requirement’. \\n\\nMain difference in consolidation basis for Solvency II and IFRS reporting \\nFor Solvency II reporting, non-Solvency II entities are not consolidated line-by-line while they are for IFRS reporting. \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n8\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\nBusiness and \\nperformance \\n\\nB  C  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nBusiness and performance continued \\n\\nRelevant operations and transactions within the group \\nIn the normal course of business, NN Group entities enter into various transactions with entities within the consolidated Group. These are \\ndescribed in chapter B.7 ‘Outsourcing’. In addition to the regular funding of the subsidiaries of NN Group, the central cash pooling activities for \\nthe Dutch subsidiaries by NN Group and the intra-group outsourcing arrangements, various intra-group transactions occurred in 2018 in the \\nnormal course of business. These include mainly: \\n∙ NN Leven and NN Interfinance have entered into a EUR 1,000 million loan agreement for the purpose of liquidity risk management. As \\n\\nper year-end 2018 NN Leven has borrowed EUR 500 million using this loan agreement\\n\\n∙ Transfer of Mortgages between NN Bank and NN Life Belgium for an amount of EUR 200 million \\n∙ Transfer of Mortgages between NN Bank and NN Non-Life for an amount of EUR 86 million  \\n\\nA.2 Underwriting Performance (see A3 below)\\nA.3 Investment Performance\\nNN Group’s operating result is analysed through a margin analysis, which includes the investment margin (investment performance), fees and \\npremium-based revenues and the technical margin (underwriting performance). For information on underwriting and investment performance \\nper material line of business, reference is made to the Financial developments section in the 2018 Financial Report and Note 30 ‘Segments’ in \\nthe 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group. For the underwriting performance of entities in scope of Solvency II, reference is made to \\nQRT S.05.01.02 ‘Premiums, claims and expenses by line of business’ and QRT S.05.02.01 ‘Premiums, claims and expenses by country’ in the \\nAppendix. \\n\\nFurther reference is made to Note 21 ‘Investment income’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for information on income and \\nexpenses arising from investments by asset class and the components of such income and expenses. \\n\\nGains and losses on investments recognised directly in equity are disclosed in Note 12 ‘Equity’- revaluation reserve and in the Consolidated \\nstatement of comprehensive income in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group. \\n\\nInformation on investment in securitisations is included in Note 44 ‘Structured entities’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group. \\nMost of the investments in securitisations issued by third parties relate to debt instruments of structured entities regarding asset-backed \\nsecurities, classified as loans. Further reference is made to Note 4 ‘Available-for-sale investments’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of \\nNN Group for more information on these investments in structured entities. \\n\\nA.4 Performance of other activities\\nOther material income and expenses incurred over 2018 are disclosed in notes 20-28 and the Financial developments section in the 2018 \\nFinancial Report of NN Group. Leasing arrangements are included in Note 28 ‘Other operating expenses’ and future rental commitments are \\ndisclosed in Note 41 ‘Contingent liabilities and commitments’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts. \\n\\nA.5 Any other information\\nReference is made to the Financial developments section in the 2018 Financial Report of NN Group for any other material information regarding \\nthe business and performance of NN Group.\\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB \\n\\nSystem of \\ngovernance \\n\\nC  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nSystem of governance \\n \\n\\nB. System of governance \\nIntroduction \\nThis chapter of the SFCR contains information on the system of the governance of NN Group in addition to governance information included in \\nthe NN Group 2018 Financial Report. The additional information includes relevant committees of the Executive Board, a description of the main \\nroles and responsibilities of the key functions and NN Group’s approach to the ‘fit and proper’ requirements and Own Risk and Solvency \\nAssessment. \\n\\nB.1 General information on the system of governance \\nThis chapter describes the structure of the committees, and explains the responsibilities, members and interdependencies of each committee. In \\nSeptember 2018, the NN Group Management Board established the NN Group Asset & Liability Committee which was approved by the NN \\nGroup Supervisory Board in November 2018. This chapter also sets out the governance and control framework effective in 2018. \\n\\nStructure of governance and changes in system of governance \\nFor a description of the structure of NN Group’s administrative, management and supervisory body, reference is made to the Corporate \\nGovernance section and the Report of the Supervisory Board, both included in the NN Group 2018 Financial Report and to the NN Group \\nwebsite: https://www.nn-group.com/Who-we-are/Corporate-governance/Corporate-governance.htm. These sources also describe the \\nmain roles and responsibilities of these bodies, provide a brief description of the segregation of responsibilities within these bodies and \\ndescribe their relevant committees. \\n\\nEB committees \\nThe Executive Board (‘EB’) of NN Group has entrusted the Management Board (‘MB’) of NN Group with the day-to-day management of NN \\nGroup and the overall strategic direction of NN Group. The Executive Board has established four committees: Crisis, Disclosure, Compensation \\nand Asset and Liability Committee.  \\n\\nThe respective charters of each committee explain the responsibilities, memberships(s) and interdependencies of each committee. \\n\\n \\n\\nCrisis Committee \\nThe main scope and responsibility of the Crisis Committee (‘CC’) is handling financial and non-financial crisis situations as defined by the MB of \\nNN Group. The Crisis Committee meets on an ad-hoc basis, but at least twice per year, face-to-face. The Crisis Committee is chaired by the \\nChief Executive Officer (‘CEO’) of NN Group. \\n\\nDisclosure Committee \\nThe Disclosure Committee’s (‘DiCo’) responsibility is to advise the EB on regular disclosures. Regular disclosures relate to the publication of NN \\nGroup’s quarterly and annual financial results. The Disclosure Committee meets at least quarterly, before the publication of the quarterly and \\nannual results of NN Group. The Disclosure Committee can also be convened on an ad-hoc basis in order to decide on (publication of) price \\nsensitive information. The Disclosure Committee is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer (‘CFO’) of NN Group. \\n\\nCompensation Committee \\nThe Compensation Committee (‘CompCo’) is responsible for reviewing and pre-approving remuneration proposals for identified staff and high \\nearners as defined in the NN Group Remuneration Framework, reviewing and approving remuneration proposals in the annual pay review for \\nindividuals who are a direct report of a Business Unit CEO or Management Board member. The CompCo is also responsible for setting, \\nmonitoring and reviewing the total spend on discretionary variable remuneration within NN Group and reviewing the design and operation of the \\nRemuneration Framework. The Compensation Committee is chaired by the Chief Organisation & Corporate Relations (‘COCR’) of NN Group. \\n\\nAsset and Liability Committee \\nThe NN Group Asset and Liability Committee (‘ALCO’) oversees the activities and market risks related to investments and the matching of \\nassets and liabilities at NN Group level. The NN Group ALCO has decision making authorities that are delegated from the NN Group \\nManagement Board. Further, the NN Group ALCO is responsible for approving decisions taken by the local ALCO and/or management board. \\nThe local ALCO and/or -management board remain responsible for these decisions. For this reason the NN Group ALCO can only approve or \\ndecline proposals and request amendments. The local ALCO and/or -management boards are required to inform the NN Group ALCO about \\nany deviations from the requested amendments including a justification of their decision. The Asset and Liability Committee is chaired by the \\nChief Risk Officer (‘CRO’) of NN Group. \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB \\n\\nSystem of \\ngovernance \\n\\nC  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nSystem of governance continued \\n \\n\\nRoles and responsibilities of key functions \\nNN Group has organised the Solvency II key functions in accordance with the applicable Solvency II regulations. All Solvency II key function \\nholders within NN Group have passed the DNB’s fit and proper test. All the Solvency II key functions are able to carry out their duties objectively \\nand free from undue influence, and do not simultaneously perform conflicting activities. They all have been given an appropriate standing in the \\norganisation and can report relevant findings directly to the relevant Board(s). \\n\\nRisk Function \\nThe Risk Function is a Solvency II key function within NN Group. \\n\\nRole \\nThe Chief Risk Officer of NN Group is the Head of the Risk Function and is entrusted with the day-to day responsibility for NN Group’s risk \\nmanagement function. The CRO steers an independent risk organisation which supports the first line in their decision making, but which also has \\nsufficient countervailing power to prevent excessive risks. The CRO must ensure that both the Management Board and the Supervisory Board \\nare at all times informed of and understand the material risks to which NN Group is exposed. \\n\\nResponsibilities \\nWithin the Management Board, the CRO is responsible for: \\n∙ Setting and monitoring compliance with NN Group’s overall risk policies \\n∙ Formulating NN Group’s risk management strategy and ensuring that it is implemented throughout the NN Group \\n∙ Supervising the operation of NN Group’s risk management and business control systems \\n∙ Reporting NN Group’s risks, as well as the processes and internal business controls \\n∙ Making risk management decisions with regard to matters which may have an impact on the financial results of NN Group or its \\n\\nreputation, without limiting the responsibility of each individual member of the Management Board in relation to risk management. \\n \\n\\nCompliance Function \\nThe Compliance Function is a Solvency II key function within NN Group. \\n\\nRole \\nTo effectively manage business conduct risk, NN Group has a Compliance Function which is headed by a Chief Compliance Officer with \\ndelegated responsibility for day-to-day management of the Compliance Function. The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the General Counsel \\n& Head of Compliance, the Member of the Management Board responsible for the Legal Function and the Compliance Function. The \\nCompliance Function is positioned independently from the business it supervises. This independent position is, amongst others, warranted by \\nindependent reporting, unrestricted access to senior management as well as structural, periodic meetings of the Chief Compliance Officer with \\nthe CEO and the Chairman of the Risk Committee of the Supervisory Board. \\n\\nResponsibilities \\nWithin NN Group’s broader risk framework, the purpose of the Compliance Function is to: \\n∙ Understand and advocate the integrity related rules, regulations and laws for the effective management of Business conduct risk; \\n\\nproactively work with and advise the business to manage Business conduct risk throughout our products’ life cycle and our business’ \\nactivities to meet stakeholder expectations \\n\\n∙ Develop and enhance the Compliance Framework to strengthen the three lines of defence to detect, communicate, manage and to report \\n\\non Business conduct risks \\n\\n∙ Support NN Group’s strategy by establishing clear roles and responsibilities to help embed good compliance practice throughout the \\n\\nbusiness by using a risk-based approach to align business outcomes with NN Group’s risk appetite \\n\\n∙ Deepen the culture of compliance by partnering with the business to increase the culture of trust, accountability, transparency and \\n\\nintegrity in evaluating, managing and reporting on Business conduct risk \\n\\n \\nAt business unit level, management establishes and maintains a Compliance Function and appoints a Local Compliance Officer (‘LCO’). The \\nLCO hierarchically reports to the CEO, to the business unit Head of Legal or to the CRO. \\n\\nThe LCOs have a functional reporting line to the Chief Compliance Officer. If business unit management decides it can meet and manage its \\ncompliance obligations without a dedicated full-time or onsite LCO, management must first obtain a waiver from the General Counsel & Head \\nof Compliance. \\n\\nInternal Audit Function \\nThe Corporate Audit Services NN Group (‘CAS’) is also a Solvency II key function within NN Group. For a description of this function, its role and \\nresponsibilities, and implementation in the NN Group structure, reference is made to section B.5. \\n\\nActuarial Function \\nThe Actuarial Function is also a Solvency II key function within NN Group.

The assessment is done \\nfor each regulated insurance entity separately and for NN Group as a whole. \\n\\nB.2 Fit and proper requirements \\nFor a description of NN Group’s specific requirements concerning skills, knowledge and expertise applicable to the people who manage NN \\nGroup, reference is made to the Profile of the Executive Board and Management Board, included in Annex 2 to both the Charter of the Executive \\nBoard of NN Group, and the Charter of the Management Board of NN Group, which charters are available on the NN Group website: \\nhttps://www.nn-group.com/Who-we-are/Corporate-governance/Corporate-governance.htm. \\n\\nAs stated in article 1.3(f) of the Charter of the Nomination and Corporate Governance Committee of the Supervisory Board of NN Group, \\nthis Committee shall at least annually review, assess and report its findings to and recommend any actions to be taken by the Supervisory \\nBoard regarding the Profile of the Executive Board and Management Board. \\n\\nRequirements concerning skills, knowledge and expertise applicable to people who have other key functions, are included in the respective job \\nprofiles. \\n\\nVarious NN Group policies and charters include provisions aiming to ensure that the people who effectively manage NN Group and the people \\nfulfilling key functions are fit and proper. During recruitment all candidates must have the professional qualifications, knowledge and experience \\nthat are required for sound and prudent management (‘fit’) and be of good reputation and have integrity (‘proper’). In an early stage of the hiring \\nprocess and preferably at the time a position has become vacant, an approval request is put forward to the external regulator (DNB or AFM). \\n\\nFor a description of NN Group’s process for assessing the fit and proper quality of the people who effectively run NN Group, reference \\nis made to article 1.4 (nn)(vii) and 2.5 of the Charter of the Supervisory Board, which is available on the NN Group website: \\nhttps://www.nn-group.com/Who-we-are/Corporate-governance/Corporate-governance.htm. As in previous years, permanent education \\nsessions were organised for the Executive Board, the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. \\n\\nAll people holding key functions are assessed against their performance objectives, leadership behaviours and any other requirements from their \\njob profiles during the annual performance cycle and specifically during the year-end appraisal. \\n\\nFurthermore, the Supervisory Board, assisted by its Audit Committee, supervises the functioning and performance of CAS and its General \\nManager. \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n12\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB \\n\\nSystem of \\ngovernance \\n\\nC  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nSystem of governance continued \\n \\n\\nB.3 Risk management system including the own risk and solvency assessment \\nDescription of NN Group’s risk management system \\nReference is made to the paragraph ‘Risk management and control systems’ in the Corporate Governance section of the Financial Report. In \\naddition, reference is made to Note 50 ‘Risk management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for a description of the risk \\nmanagement system, which comprises of strategies, processes and reporting procedures, and how NN Group is able to effectively identify, \\nassess, monitor, manage and report, on a continuous basis, the risks to which NN Group is or could be exposed on an individual and aggregated \\nlevel. In the same note, a description is included on how the risk management system including the risk management function are implemented \\nand integrated into the organisational structure and decision-making processes of NN Group. \\n\\nOwn Risk and Solvency Assessment \\nBusiness strategy and objectives, key risk appetite statements, risk and capital management are aligned in the Own Risk and Solvency \\nAssessment (‘ORSA’) in synchronisation with the yearly medium-term business plan. The ORSA report supports the Management Board in \\nassessing the overall risk and capital profile of the business under a wide range of scenarios. \\n\\nThe ORSA is defined as the entirety of the processes and procedures employed to identify, assess, monitor, manage and report the short and \\nlong-term risks a (re)insurance legal entity faces or may face and to determine the own funds necessary to ensure that the entity’s overall \\nsolvency needs are met at all times. In particular, the ORSA: \\n∙ Is a specific instrument within NN Group’s risk management system: it is a high level forward looking analysis on capital adequacy under a \\n\\nwide range of scenarios based on the current and emerging risk profile of an entity, given its strategy and risk appetite \\n\\n∙ Does not serve to calculate the capital requirement, although capital add-ons can be considered as a result of the ORSA \\n∙ Is an integral part of business planning \\n \\nAs such, the ORSA is linked to the strategic management process and related decision-making framework as illustrated below: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nRegular frequency \\nNN Group (and each of its regulated insurance subsidiaries) prepares an ORSA at least once a year. In the ORSA, NN Group articulates its \\nstrategy and risk appetite; describes its key risks and how they are managed; analyses whether or not its risks and capital are appropriately \\nmodelled; and evaluates how susceptible the capital position is to shocks through stress testing and scenario testing. Stress testing examines \\nthe effect of exceptional but plausible scenarios on the capital position of NN Group. Stress testing can also be initiated outside the ORSA, \\neither internally or by external parties such as DNB and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (‘EIOPA’). \\n\\nSimilar as with the insurance entities, NN Group’s banking and investment management operations run annually an internal capital adequacy \\nassessment process (‘ICAAP’) in conformity with Basel III requirements. ICAAP tests whether current capital positions are adequate for the \\nfinancial risks that the relevant NN Group entities bear. \\n\\nMonitoring between regular ORSAs: possible ad-hoc ORSA \\nTo the extent necessary, outcomes of the ORSA are translated in ad-hoc ORSA triggers (i.e. events that lead to a significant shock in the risk \\nprofile and/or capital position), risk metrics and management actions for identified material risks. Monitoring of ad-hoc ORSA triggers and risk \\nmetrics is performed as part of the regular Finance & Risk control cycle. Developments are documented in internal Finance & Risk reports and \\ndiscussed during board and/or delegated committee meetings. CROs within NN Group are responsible for identifying the need of a(n) (partial) \\nad-hoc ORSA. NN Group will be informed as soon as possible when the decision for a(n) (partial) ad-hoc ORSA is made in a business unit. In \\nsuch cases, the relevant national supervisory authority is also informed. \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB \\n\\nSystem of \\ngovernance \\n\\nC  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nSystem of governance continued \\n \\n\\nThe regular ORSA process as undertaken within NN Group \\nStrategy and risk appetite \\nA thorough re-assessment of strategy is usually done once every 3-5 years or when material developments in the external or internal \\nenvironment give rise to an earlier re-assessment. Yearly assessments are made in the first half of the year whether to adjust the strategy for \\ndevelopments in the past year and/or revised assumptions on the future. Setting (and adjusting) the risk appetite is inextricably part of strategy \\nsetting (and adjusting). \\n\\nRisk Assessment \\nKey to the ORSA is the identification of potentially solvency threatening risks for legal entities by management boards, given their strategy and \\nrisk appetite. Basis for this risk assessment is NN Group’s risk taxonomy. Modelled risks are subject to an appropriateness test (see below) and \\nadditional statistical stress testing (see below), both contributing to adequate capitalisation of these risks. Focus is therefore on non-modelled \\nrisks. \\n\\nAppropriateness test of regulatory capital calculation \\nThe assumptions and models for calculating regulatory solvency requirements are assessed against the actual risk profile. Differences are \\nanalysed in terms of future model improvements and/or non-modelled risks. The outcome of the analysis may lead to mitigating actions to \\novercome model shortcomings. If the deviations or uncertainties are considered material, quantification of the deviation is necessary in order to \\nconsider a (temporary) self-imposed capital add-on. \\n\\nCapital projections \\nThe projection basis is consistent with the best estimate assumptions and parameters used for the Business Plan best estimate financial \\nforecasts, among others the yearly updated Macro Economic Scenario. \\n\\nThe Actuarial Function is to confirm that the base-case and projected technical provisions represent a true and fair view of future liabilities. The \\nActuarial Function also provides input concerning the risks arising from the calculation of technical provisions. \\n\\nRegulatory solvency is at the heart of the ORSA: NN Group must ensure that it is able to meet regulatory required solvency ratios of all \\n(re)insurance companies and NN Group consolidated at all times. In addition, NN Group and relevant subsidiaries assess: \\n∙ The quantity and quality of Own Funds over the Business Plan period \\n∙ The composition of Own Funds across tiers and how this composition may change as a result of redemption, repayment and maturity \\n\\ndates during the Business Plan period \\n\\n \\nAs - in principle - only NN Group raises capital in the financial markets, the group ORSA is to: \\n∙ Identify internal and external sources of capital if additional new capital is necessary \\n∙ Assess availability, transferability and fungibility of capital within the group, including businesses in non-EEA countries \\n∙ Reference any planned material transfer of capital within the group and its consequences \\n∙ Determine the capital plan for funding the capital needed by the subsidiaries \\n \\nStress testing and overall assessment of capital adequacy \\nBased on the Business Plan and the outcomes of the risk assessment, (reverse) stress scenarios and their parameters are developed and \\ndocumented. The Management Board is responsible for identifying the key uncertainties and the related scenarios. \\n\\nScenario testing, as well as (reverse) stress testing are required for each ORSA. At the same time, the group ORSA will assess any local stress \\nscenario that may significantly impacts NN Group’s capital position and perform statistical stress tests (based on 1-in-20 shocks) on modelled \\nrisks. When the outcomes of performed stress tests show solvency ratios dropping below 100%, realistic strategies for recovering solvency \\nratios will be considered and documented in the ORSA report. For Business Units, a capital downstream can only be considered if there is no \\nother feasible management option left. \\n\\nUltimately, after all assessments and considerations (including formulated management actions) the ORSA is to conclude whether, going \\nforward, the entity concerned is adequately capitalised under a wide range of scenarios over the planning horizon. \\n\\nGovernance of NN Group’s Partial Internal Model \\nThe responsible departments and committees for NN Group’s Partial Internal Model and how they interact with the Executive and Supervisory \\nBoard are disclosed in the Corporate Governance section of the 2018 Financial report and in section B.1 ‘General information on the system of \\ngovernance’ above. \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n14\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB \\n\\nSystem of \\ngovernance \\n\\nC  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nSystem of governance continued \\n \\n\\nModel Validation \\nNN Group’s model governance and Model Validation Department seeks to ensure that NN Group’s models are fit for their intended purpose. \\nModels and their disclosed metrics are approved by the Model Committee. The findings of the Model Validation Department are also reported \\nto the Model Committee, via regular validations. This committee is responsible for modelling policies, processes, methodologies and parameters \\nwhich are applied within NN Group. Furthermore, the Model Validation Department carries out validations of risk and valuation models \\nparticularly those related to Solvency II. Any changes to models that affect NN Group risk figures above a certain materiality threshold are \\npresented to the Model Committee. \\n\\nModel validation is not a one-off assessment of a model, but an ongoing process whereby the reliability of the model is verified at different \\nstages during its lifecycle: at initiation, before approval, when the model has been redeveloped or modified and on a regular basis discussed and \\nagreed with Model Development. It is not a mere verification of the mathematics or statistics of the model, but encompasses both a quantitative \\nand qualitative assessment of the model. Accordingly, the validation process covers a mix of developmental evidence assessment, process \\nverification and outcome analysis. \\n\\nThe validation cycle is based on a five-year period. This means that at least once every five years a model in scope will be independently \\nvalidated. In general, the validation frequency relates to the relative materiality of the models in scope. In addition, reference is also made for \\nmore detail to Note 50 ‘Risk management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group. \\n\\nChanges in the governance of NN Group’s Partial Internal Model \\nOn 5 December 2018, NN Group announced that it received approval from DNB to expand its Partial Internal Model under Solvency II to include \\nthe Delta Lloyd Life and Non-life entity in the Netherlands. The expanded approved Partial Internal Model is used to calculate regulatory capital \\nrequirements effective as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nB.4 The Internal control system and Compliance Function \\nReference is made to Note 50 ‘Risk management’ of the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for a description of the \\nimplementation of the Internal control system and Compliance Function. \\n\\nB.5 Internal Audit Function \\nCorporate Audit Services NN Group (CAS), the internal audit department of NN Group, is an independent assurance function. Its responsibilities, \\nestablished by the Executive Board of NN Group N.V., are pre-discussed with the Audit Committee and approved by the Supervisory Board of \\nNN Group N.V. The Dutch Financial Supervision Act (\\'Wet op het financieel toezicht\\'), Dutch Corporate Governance Code and Solvency II \\nrequire NN Group to have an internal audit department which independently assesses the effectiveness of the design of the governance and the \\nquality of procedures and control measures. CAS is responsible for executing the Internal Audit Function of an NN entity provided NN has 100% \\nownership, has a majority stake and management control or has no majority stake but effectively has management control. The area of work \\n(audit universe) is defined as every activity, department and office of NN Group, including branches, subsidiaries as well as outsourced activities \\n(with a \\'right-to-audit\\' clause). CAS is an essential part of the corporate governance structure of NN Group. \\n\\nCAS keeps close contact with home country and local supervisors and regulators as well as with the external auditor via regular meetings in \\nwhich current (audit) issues are discussed as well as internal and external developments and their impact on NN Group and CAS. CAS also \\nexchanges information such as risk assessments and relevant (audit) reports. \\n\\nThe General Manager and staff of CAS are authorised to: \\n∙ Obtain, without delay, from General Managers within NN Group, any significant incident concerning NN Group’s operations including but \\n\\nnot limited to security, reputation and/or compliance with regulations and procedures \\n\\n∙ Obtain, without delay, from responsible managers within NN Group, a copy of all letters and reports received from external review \\n\\nagencies (e.g. external auditor, supervisors, regulators and other agencies providing assurance related services) \\n\\n∙ Free, full, unrestricted and unfettered access at any time deemed appropriate to all NN Group departments, offices, activities, books, \\n\\naccounts, records, files, information. CAS must respect the confidentiality of (personal) information acquired \\n\\n∙ Require all NN Group staff and business management to supply such information and explanations, as may be needed for the \\n\\nperformance of assessments, within a reasonable period of time \\n\\n∙ Allocate resources, set frequencies, select subjects, determine scope of work and apply appropriate techniques required to accomplish \\n\\nthe CAS’s objectives \\n\\n∙ Obtain the necessary assistance of personnel in various departments/offices of NN Group where CAS performs audits, as well as other \\nspecialised/professional services where considered necessary from within or outside NN Group. CAS should exercise its authority with \\nthe minimum possible disruption to the day-to-day activities of the area being assessed \\n\\n \\nIn compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Executive Board is responsible for the role and functioning of CAS, \\nsupervised by the Supervisory Board, supported by the Audit Committee. The General Manager of CAS is accountable to the CEO and \\nfunctionally to the chair of the Audit Committee. On a day-to-day basis the General Manager of CAS reports to the CEO. \\n\\nCAS performs its work in accordance with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing Standards and Code of \\nEthics set by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), and with other relevant authorities or professional associations (e.g. NBA, NOREA). These \\nprofessional standards are incorporated in the CAS Audit Manual. Compliance to the audit manual is embedded at various levels in the audit \\nprocess and includes review by the independent positioned Professional Practices Management team within NN Group CAS. On a periodic \\nbasis CAS globally is subject to an independent external assessment. \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB \\n\\nSystem of \\ngovernance \\n\\nC  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nSystem of governance continued \\n \\n\\nB.6 Actuarial Function \\nThe mission of the Actuarial Function is to reduce the risk of unreliable and inadequate technical provisions with regard to both Solvency II and \\nIFRS reporting. This contributes to an enhanced perception by clients, regulators and investors alike of the financial solidity of NN Group. \\n\\nThe Actuarial Function operates within the context of NN Group’s broader risk management system. Within this system, the role of the Actuarial \\nFunction is to: \\n∙ Understand and advocate the rules, regulations and laws for effective management of the calculation process of technical provisions, \\nunderwriting and reinsurance arrangements; proactively advise the business to manage the risk of unreliable and inadequate technical \\nprovisions \\n\\n∙ Develop and enhance tools to strengthen the three lines of defence to detect, communicate, manage and to report on risks related to \\n\\nunreliable or inadequate technical provisions \\n\\n∙ Support NN Group’s strategy by establishing clear roles and responsibilities to help embed good (actuarial) practices throughout the \\n\\norganisation by using a risk-based approach to align insights with NN Group’s risk appetite \\n\\n∙ Strengthen the culture of professional risk management by challenging management and experts to increase the culture of trust, \\n\\naccountability, transparency and integrity in evaluating, managing and reporting on risks to unreliable or inadequate technical provisions \\n\\n \\nReference is made to Note 50 ‘Risk management’ of the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for a description of the Actuarial \\nFunction. \\n\\nB.7 Outsourcing \\nExternal Outsourcing arrangements \\nNN Group has outsourced part of its IT processes to external service providers. There are no significant provisions recognised for doubtful debts \\nor individually significant bad debt expenses on outstanding balances with these providers. \\n\\nFor these external outsourcing arrangements written service level agreements are in place, setting out: \\n∙ The mutual rights and obligations of the parties \\n∙ The duties and responsibilities of all parties involved \\n∙ The Service Provider’s commitment to comply with applicable local laws and regulatory requirements, applicable to the outsourced \\n\\nfunction or activity and to cooperate with the Outsourcing Entity’s relevant supervisory authority with regard to the outsourced function or \\nactivity \\n\\n∙ The Service Provider’s obligation to disclose any development which may have a material impact on its ability to carry out the outsourced \\n\\nfunctions and activities effectively and in compliance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements \\n\\n∙ That the Service Provider and the Outsourcing Entity can only terminate the contract with a notice period  \\n∙ That the Outsourcing Entity is able to terminate the arrangement for outsourcing where necessary without detriment to the continuity and \\n\\nquality of its provision of services to the policyholder and other clients \\n\\n∙ That the Outsourcing Entity reserves the right to be informed about the outsourced functions and activities and their performance by the \\nService Provider as well as a right to issue general guidelines and individual instructions at the address of the Service Provider, as to what \\nhas to be taken into account when performing the outsourced functions or activities \\n\\n \\nIntra-group Outsourcing arrangements \\nIn the normal course of business, NN Group entities enter into various transactions with entities within the consolidated Group. Transactions with \\nentities within the consolidated Group take place on an arm’s length basis and include distribution agreements, human resources-related \\narrangements and rendering and receiving of services. There are no significant provisions recognised for doubtful debts or individually significant \\nbad debt expenses on outstanding balances within the Group. \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n16\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB \\n\\nSystem of \\ngovernance \\n\\nC  D \\n\\nE \\n\\nSystem of governance continued \\n \\n\\nentities \\n\\nNetherlands \\n\\nLloyd entities) \\n\\nAll intra-group transactions are conducted under market-consistent conditions.

The following risk categories have been disclosed: \\n\\nC.1 Non-market risk (Underwriting risk) \\nNon-Market risk is disclosed as insurance risk and business risk for the business units applying Internal Model and life risk, health risk and non-life \\nrisk for the business units applying Standard Formula in Note 50 ‘Risk management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts. \\n\\nC.2 Market risk \\nMarket risk is disclosed in Note 50 ‘Risk management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts. \\n\\nC.3 Counterparty risk (Credit risk) \\nCounterparty Default risk is disclosed in Note 50 ‘Risk management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts. \\n\\nC.4 Liquidity risk \\nNN Group identifies two related liquidity risks: funding liquidity risks and market liquidity risks. These risks are disclosed in Note 50 ‘Risk \\nmanagement’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts. \\n\\nC.5 Operational risk \\nFor operational risk NN Group has developed a framework governing the process of identifying, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and reporting \\noperational risks. Operational risk is disclosed in Note 50 ‘Risk management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts. \\n\\nC.6 Other material risks \\nBusiness conduct risk \\nBusiness conduct risk is the risk related to unethical or irresponsible corporate behaviour, inappropriate employee behaviour and customer \\nsuitability of products. For more details reference is made to Note 50 ‘Risk management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts. \\n\\nConcentration risks \\nNN Group does not have an appetite for risk concentration and manages concentration risk with a limit structure. During the year the limit \\nstructure was updated to reflect the larger balance sheet after the acquisition of Delta Lloyd. More information on the mitigation of several \\ntypes of concentration risk is included in Note 50 ‘Risk Management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts. \\n\\nInvesting assets in accordance with the ‘Prudent person principle’ \\nAcceptable investments \\nNN Group complies with the prudent person principles as set out in Directive 2009/138/EC/article 132: Prudent person principle. NN Group \\nmaintains a Global Asset List, which contains all asset classes in which NN Group and its subsidiaries are allowed to invest. Before an asset \\nclass is approved for this list, a specific assessment, called ‘New Asset Class Assessment’ (‘NACA’) must be followed. \\n\\nThe NACA should describe all relevant considerations on return, risk and operational consequences that are relevant to the decision whether a \\nBusiness Unit of NN Group should invest in the proposed investment class. \\n\\nThe NACA request does not describe a specific transaction, but is a proposal for the potential investment in an investment class. The NACA \\nshould nevertheless address the quantitative impact of potential future investments and include proposed portfolio limits for the product. This \\nshould always be in line with NN Group internal policies as well as external constraints (such as regulatory limits). \\n\\nGovernance of investments \\nWithin the Three Lines-of-Defence model, investments are managed in the first line through a dedicated Central Investment Office, reporting \\ndirectly to the CEO of NN Group, in cooperation with the business units. The second line function is performed by Group Financial Risk \\nManagement, which reports to the CRO of NN Group and local risk teams. Operational activities regarding investments are performed by NN \\nGroup’s business unit NN Investment Partners or third parties, which also provide advice on proposed or current investments. \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C \\n2 \\n\\nRisk profile \\n\\nD \\n\\nE \\n\\nRisk profile continued \\n \\n\\nAll investments related activities are performed within the boundaries as set by NN Group.

Reference is made to section A1 ‘Business’ for more information on the difference \\narising from the scope of consolidation. The impact from this difference is reflected above in the column ‘Consolidation scope’. The most \\nimportant differences arising from the scope of consolidation are caused by NN Bank and NN Life Japan. \\n\\nThe valuation and presentation differences between IFRS and Solvency II resulting from differences in accounting principles and methods are \\nexplained in the sections below. For items where no valuation difference occurred, reference is made to Note 1 ‘Accounting policies’, Note 33 \\n‘Fair value of financial assets and liabilities’ and Note 34 ‘Fair value of non-financial assets’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN \\nGroup for a description of the bases, methods and main assumptions used for their valuation. \\n\\nDetails of valuation, presentation and consolidation differences are included in Section D.1-D.3 below. \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n20\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3  Valuation for \\n\\nE \\n\\nSolvency purposes \\n\\nValuation for Solvency purposes continued \\n \\n\\nD.1 Assets \\nAccounting principles, methods and main assumptions used \\nIn general, Solvency II valuation requires a market consistent approach to the valuation of assets and liabilities. The default reference framework \\nfor valuing assets and liabilities, other than technical provisions, is IFRS as endorsed by the European Union (‘IFRS-EU’). The exception is if the \\nIFRS valuation principle does not reflect a market consistent valuation (e.g. amortised cost). For main assumptions used in fair valuing assets, \\nreference is made to Note 33 ‘Fair value of financial assets and liabilities’ and to Note 34 ‘Fair value of non-financial assets’ in the 2018 \\nConsolidated annual accounts of NN Group. \\n\\nCash and cash equivalents \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents are reported at the notional amount. In the Solvency II balance sheet, cash and cash \\nequivalents are reported at market value. There are no significant valuation differences between IFRS and Solvency II for cash and cash \\nequivalents as the market value is not significantly different from the notional value. Total presentation differences of EUR -4,326 million as at 31 \\nDecember 2018 are caused by the presentation of short term deposits and money market funds as investments (excluding loans) in the \\nSolvency II balance sheet. Differences due to a different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR -3,340 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nInvestments (excluding loans) \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, investments are reported at fair value. In the Solvency II balance sheet, investments are reported at market value. \\nThere are no significant valuation differences between IFRS and Solvency II for investments as fair value generally equals market value. \\nPresentation differences of EUR 5,387 million as at 31 December 2018 are caused by: \\n∙ Presentation of money market funds as investments under Solvency II, instead of their inclusion in cash and cash equivalents under IFRS \\n∙ Presentation of accrued interest as part of the investments, instead of a separate presentation as accrual under IFRS. Solvency II requires \\n\\naccrued interest to be presented as part of the investments (‘dirty market value’) and not separately as other assets as in the 2018 \\nConsolidated annual accounts of NN Group (‘clean market value’) \\n\\n∙ Presentation of certain Asset Backed Securities as investments under Solvency II, instead of their presentation as loans in the 2018 \\n\\nConsolidated annual accounts \\n\\n \\nDifferences due to a different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR -19,550 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nValuation of certain Asset Backed Securities as investments (excluding loans) under Solvency II, instead of their presentation as loans in the \\n2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group amounted EUR 99 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nLoans \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, loans are reported at amortised cost. In the Solvency II balance sheet, loans are reported at market value. For loans \\nthat are repriced frequently and have had no significant changes in credit risk, the carrying values in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of \\nNN Group represent a reasonable estimate of the market value for Solvency II. For other loans the market value is estimated by discounting \\nexpected future cash flows using a discount rate that reflects credit risk, liquidity and other current market conditions. The market value of \\nmortgage loans is estimated by taking into account prepayment behaviour. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for calculation \\npurposes. \\n\\nValuation differences between IFRS and Solvency II for loans represents the difference between amortised cost and market value of EUR 687 \\nmillion as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nPresentation differences of EUR 874 million as at 31 December 2018 are caused by: \\n∙ The different presentation of accrued interest. Solvency II requires accrued interest to be presented as part of the loans (‘dirty market \\n\\nvalue’) and not separately as other assets as in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group (‘clean market value’) \\n\\n∙ Presentation of short term deposits as investments under Solvency II, instead of their inclusion in cash and cash equivalents under IFRS \\n∙ The presentation of certain Asset Backed Securities as investments (excluding loans) under Solvency II, instead of their presentation as \\n\\nloans in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group \\n\\n \\nDifferences in loans recognised in the IFRS and the Solvency II Balance sheets due to a different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR -\\n18,460 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nReinsurance contracts \\nReference is made to section D2 ‘Technical provisions’ of this SFCR. \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3  Valuation for \\n\\nE \\n\\nSolvency purposes \\n\\nValuation for Solvency purposes continued \\n \\n\\nAssociates and joint ventures (Holdings in related undertakings) \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, associates and joint ventures are reported at net asset value (equity accounting). \\n\\nIn the Solvency II balance sheet, non-Solvency II entities are recognised as associates and measured at the local regulatory capital in \\naccordance with the local (sectoral) rules instead of consolidating all balance sheet items line-by-line. Differences in Associates and joint \\nventures recognised in the IFRS and the Solvency II Balance sheets due to a different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR 3,777 million as \\nat 31 December 2018 (IFRS values). Valuation differences of EUR -1,320 million as at 31 December 2018 represents the difference between the \\nvalue of the consolidated line items under IFRS and the local regulatory capital of these entities. The presentation difference of EUR -193 million \\nas at 31 December 2018 consists of receivables from associates that are presented as part of the other assets in the Solvency II balance sheet. \\n\\nAll holdings in related undertakings were either valued using quoted market prices in active markets or by using the adjusted equity method \\n(when a quoted market price was not available). \\n\\nReal estate investments \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, real estate investments are reported at fair value. In the Solvency II balance sheet, real estate investments are \\nreported at market value. There are no significant valuation differences between IFRS and Solvency II for real estate investments as fair value \\ngenerally equals market value. There are no differences in real estate investments due to a different scope of consolidation. \\n\\nProperty and equipment \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, property in own use is reported at fair value. In the Solvency II balance sheet, property in own use is reported at \\nmarket value. There are no significant valuation differences between IFRS and Solvency II for property in own use as fair value generally equals \\nmarket value. In the IFRS balance sheet, equipment is reported at cost less depreciation. In the Solvency II balance sheet, equipment is reported \\nat market value. There are no significant valuation differences between IFRS and Solvency II for equipment, as market value is generally not \\nsignificantly different from depreciated cost. Differences in property and equipment recognised in the IFRS and the Solvency II Balance sheets \\ndue to a different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR -9 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nIntangible assets \\nGoodwill and Value of Business Acquired (‘VOBA’) are not recognised for Solvency II purposes. Other intangibles including software can be \\nrecognised and measured at a value other than nil if they can be sold separately and if there is a quoted market price in an active market for the \\nsame or similar intangible assets. As there is no quoted market price for NN Group’s other intangible assets, it is valued at nil for Solvency II \\npurposes. \\n\\nDeferred acquisition costs \\nDeferred Acquisition Costs are not recognised for Solvency II purposes. \\n\\nDeferred taxes \\nUnder IFRS, deferred tax assets are part of the other assets. In the IFRS balance sheet, deferred taxes, other than deferred tax assets arising \\nfrom the carry forward of unused tax credits and the carry forward of unused tax losses, are valued on the basis of the difference between the \\ntax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values. A positive value to deferred taxes is only attributed where it is probable that future \\ntaxable profit will be available against which the deferred tax asset can be used, taking into account any legal or regulatory requirements on the \\ntime limits relating to the carry forward of unused tax losses or credits. \\n\\nReference is made to Note 32 ‘Taxation’ of the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for more information on the origin of the \\nrecognition of deferred tax assets and the amount and expiry date of deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses and unused tax \\ncredits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the IFRS balance sheet. \\n\\nIn the Solvency II balance sheet, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised and valued in conformity with IFRS. Differences in deferred tax \\nassets due to differences in valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities amounted to EUR 643 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nOther assets \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, other assets are reported at their notional amounts. In the Solvency II balance sheet, other assets (with the exclusion \\nof deferred taxes) are reported at market value. \\n\\nPresentation differences of EUR -1,789 million as at 31 December 2018 consist of the different presentation of accrued interest. Solvency II \\nrequires accrued interest to be presented as part of the interest bearing investments (‘dirty market value’) and not separately as other assets as \\nin the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group (‘clean market value’). \\n\\nDifferences in other assets recognised in the IFRS and the Solvency II Balance sheets due to a different scope of consolidation amounted to \\nEUR -1,082 million as at 31 December 2018.

Index-linked and Unit-linked \\nTotal \\n \\nBases, methods and main assumptions used for solvency valuation \\nTechnical Provisions are measured for Solvency II purposes as the sum of the BEL and RM. The BEL are equal to the probability-weighted \\naverage of the present value of the future liability cash flows. The RM is defined as the amount that an empty (re)insurance entity is expected to \\nrequire in excess of the BEL in order to take over and meet the (re-)insurance obligations. \\n\\n Risk margin  \\n \\n100 \\n16 \\n5,242 \\n188 \\n752 \\n6,298 \\n \\n\\nBest Estimate \\nLiabilities \\n \\n2,112 \\n291 \\n111,087 \\n3,120 \\n28,040 \\n144,650 \\n \\n\\nTechnical \\nprovisions \\n \\n2,212 \\n307 \\n116,329 \\n3,308 \\n28,792 \\n150,948 \\n \\n\\nBest estimate of liabilities \\nNN Group uses cash flow models and best estimate assumptions to determine the BEL under Solvency II. Premiums, benefits, expenses and \\nother relevant cash flows are projected for the policy term – subject to contract boundaries – and discounted at the currency specific risk-free \\ninterest rate term structure, including the Ultimate Forward Rate (‘UFR’), to allow for financial risk with the currency specific Credit Risk \\nAdjustments (‘CRA’) and country specific Volatility Adjustment (‘VOLA’). This is the full-cash flow approach and is typical for traditional business. \\nFor unit-linked business, only margins are projected (expenses and charges) as investment risks are borne by the policyholder. Cash flows are \\neither projected on a per policy basis or individual policies are grouped into representative model points. \\n\\nAt the end of 2018, the UFR for EUR under Solvency II was set at 4.05%. In April 2017, EIOPA published an updated methodology to derive \\nthe UFR and in line with this updated methodology, the calculated value of the UFR for EUR is 3.60%, but annual changes to the UFR will not \\nbe higher than 15 basis points. Therefore the UFR for EUR is expected to decrease from 4.05% to 3.90% from 1 January 2019.  \\n\\nCash flows are projected along a sufficiently large number of future risk-free interest rate scenarios to allow for one-sided financial options and \\nguarantees. This is typical for traditional business with profit sharing on top of a fixed interest rate guarantee and unit-linked products with a \\nguaranteed return. The best estimate risk-free interest rate term structure (with CRA and VOLA, if applicable) is used in those instances where \\nthere are no embedded options or guarantees. \\n\\nThe cash flow projections consider future management actions that can be taken to mitigate the loss to NN Group, management policy \\ncovering the distribution of future discretionary benefits and the predictability and profit sharing of liability cash flows. The cash flow projections \\nused in the calculation of the BEL are based on the best estimate assumptions. The cash flow projection reflects the expected realistic future \\ndemographic, legal, medical, technological, social, environmental and economic developments that have a material impact on the BEL. \\n\\nAssumptions underlying the BEL are portfolio-specific rather than entity-specific. Entity-specific assumptions are used only insofar as those \\nassumptions enable the entity to better reflect the characteristics of the portfolio or where the calculation of the BEL in a realistic, reliable and \\nobjective manner without those assumptions is not possible. \\n\\nFor each material line of business, a quantitative and qualitative explanation of material differences between the bases, methods and main \\nassumptions used for the valuation for solvency purposes and those used for their valuation in financial statements are included in the local \\nActuarial Function Reports prepared by the local Actuarial Function Holders (‘AFHs’). \\n\\nFor unmodelled business, Technical Provisions are estimated either by scaling of modelled business or by setting Solvency II Technical Provisions \\nequal to IFRS insurance liabilities. The AFH considers the application of these approaches to estimating Technical Provisions of unmodelled \\nbusiness when providing his/her opinion. \\n\\nReinsurance and other recoverables \\nThe BEL are estimated gross, without deduction of the amounts recoverable from reinsurance contracts. The amounts recoverable from \\nreinsurance contracts and expected losses due to counterparty default are calculated separately. The principles used to calculate the amounts \\nrecoverable are consistent with those underlying the calculation of the gross BEL. \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3  Valuation for \\n\\nE \\n\\nSolvency purposes \\n\\nValuation for Solvency purposes continued \\n \\n\\nRisk margin \\nIn addition to the BEL a RM is held to allow for non-hedgeable market and non-market risks. The calculation of the RM is performed by either \\nexplicitly calculating the SCR for each future year or by using a driver approach. Long term guarantee (‘LTG’) measures are excluded from the \\ncalculation of the SCRs and in the discounting, when calculating the RM. \\n\\nWith the driver approach, the relevant sub-risk SCRs - either Internal Model or Standard Formula - are projected using appropriate risk drivers, \\nmultiplied by the cost of capital of 6%, then discounted at the relevant risk free rate term structure. The sub-risk margins are aggregated using \\nthe relevant diversification factors. This calculation is performed by main products for the material Business Units. Note that this is a \\nsimplification as Solvency II requires the individual SCRs to be diversified at each future point in time. NN Group’s simplification does not lead to \\na material misestimation of the RM (less than 1%). \\n\\nAssumptions \\nNon-financial assumptions \\nBest estimate assumptions are set for expenses, mortality, morbidity and other relevant insurance risks using historical experience of the \\ninsurance portfolio. Assumptions are reviewed by each entity at least annually and submitted to the Chief Actuary Office (‘CAO’) for review and \\nsubmitted to the Group Model Committee (‘MoC’) for information or, depending on materiality, for the MoC to advise the Chief Risk Officer and \\nChief Financial Officer or the NN Group Management Board, following NN Group’s model governance. \\n\\nPolicyholder behaviour regarding lapses, partial and full surrenders and paid-ups are taken into account for individual life business for traditional \\nand unit-linked portfolios subject to the boundaries of the contracts. Policyholder behaviour is typically not considered for non-life and group life \\nbusiness. \\n\\nManagement actions are reflected in the cash flow projections. These are mostly current management actions related to dynamic decision rules \\nin the asset liability models of NN Group. Future management actions are assumed for portfolios including discretionary benefits. \\n\\nBoundaries of insurance contracts are set by the Business Units based on a detailed investigation of terms and conditions of their portfolios. \\nThese assessments were reviewed and acknowledged at Head Office without comparing the different practices. \\n\\nFinancial assumptions \\nNN Group follows EIOPA requirements in determining the basic risk-free rates and the VOLA to determine the relevant currency specific risk \\nfree rate term structure for valuation of Technical Provisions. Because EIOPA curves are not available in time for NN Group’s entities to start \\ntheir valuations, NN Group follows the EIOPA methodology to independently produce the curves. These are then compared to the published \\nEIOPA curves when these are made available to ensure consistency between the EIOPA and the NN Group manufactured curves. At year-\\nend 2018, the EIOPA and NN Group curves were consistent. \\n\\nChanges in assumptions \\nDuring 2018, all Business Units reviewed their best estimate assumptions as part of the regular process and updated them where necessary to \\nreflect new insights. \\n\\nOptions and guarantees \\nWhen establishing technical provisions at NN Group, all material financial guarantees and contractual options included within the boundary of \\ninsurance and reinsurance policies are taken into account. In doing so, factors which may affect the likelihood that policyholders will exercise \\ncontractual options or realise the value of financial guarantees are analysed. \\n\\nThe intrinsic value of financial options and guarantees is reflected in the single (deterministic) cash flow projection of technical provisions. These \\ninclude the interest rate guarantees implicit in traditional products found throughout NN Group as well as policyholder options such as paid-up, \\nguaranteed insurability options, and automatic inflation protection, where material. \\n\\nA stochastic model is required to determine the time value of options and guarantees (‘TVoG’) where cash flows vary asymmetrically with \\nmarket returns. The stochastic model uses a number of Monte Carlo simulations (typically, 1,000 to 3,500) to project future cash flows under \\nvarious economic scenarios. The number of scenarios is set in order to reduce the simulation error to within the tolerance level. Currently, such \\nerror should be less than 1% of the best estimate liabilities, as determined by taking the 80% confidence interval of the mean standard error of \\nthe simulations. NN Group’s Business Units perform a test to ensure the simulation error is within the established limits and increase the number \\nof scenarios used if the test does not satisfy the requirements. Nearly the entire TVoG for NN Group is from Japan Closed Block VA and the \\nDutch group pension business. \\n\\nDynamic policyholder behaviour has been reflected where it is deemed material to the valuation under the different economic environments \\nreflected in the stochastic scenarios. Where future profit sharing is dependent on economic conditions, the variability is taken into account in the \\nTVoG. Where management actions have been taken into account, these are consistent with policies signed-off by the respective boards. \\n\\nActuarial Function Holders throughout the reporting entities of NN Group have assessed the allowances made in respect of options and \\nguarantees in the technical provisions and the underlying assumptions, and came to the conclusion that such allowances are appropriate. \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n24\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3  Valuation for \\n\\nE \\n\\nSolvency purposes \\n\\nValuation for Solvency purposes continued \\n \\n\\nLevel of Uncertainty \\nFor the level of uncertainty associated with the value of the technical provision, reference is made to Note 50 ‘Risk Management’ in the 2018 \\nConsolidated annual accounts of NN Group. \\n\\nMain differences between IFRS and Solvency II valuation of technical provisions \\n\\nAs at 31 December 2018.

NN Group operates in many different countries and the accounting principles for insurance contracts follow local practice in \\nthese countries. NN Group’s businesses in the Netherlands, for example apply accounting standards generally accepted in the \\nNetherlands (‘Dutch GAAP’) for their provisions for liabilities under insurance contracts. For the Delta Lloyd business units acquired by NN \\nin 2017, insurance liabilities were established at the acquisition date following IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’. \\n\\n∙ The BEL in Solvency II are calculated for all entities as the expected present value of future liability cash flows using best estimate \\n\\n∙ A RM for non-hedgeable market and non-market risks is added to the BEL to establish the Solvency II technical provisions and also the \\n\\nassumptions. \\n\\nIFRS provisions of the Delta Lloyd entities. \\n\\n∙ Different interest rates are used for calculation of insurance and investment contracts under IFRS and Solvency II. For Solvency II a risk-\\nfree interest rate curve with credit risk, VOLA and UFR where applicable is used. None of the entities within NN Group apply a matching \\nadjustment. For IFRS a fixed interest rate/guaranteed technical interest rate is used and for certain non-life insurance contracts \\ndiscounting is not applied. \\n\\n∙ The present value of future profits is recognised in Solvency II technical provisions but not in IFRS insurance liabilities. \\n∙ The difference between IFRS and Solvency II provisions is primarily reflected in the Life line of Business, where IFRS insurance liabilities \\n\\nlargely reflect assumptions - interest, mortality, morbidity, expense, etc. - locked-in at policy issue, which can depart significantly from the \\nbest estimate assumptions reflected in the Solvency II provisioning. For the Delta Lloyd entities, the acquisition date is considered the \\npolicy issue date. The locked-in actuarial assumptions reflect best estimates at the acquisition date. \\n\\n∙ For index-linked and unit-linked insurance, the IFRS insurance liabilities are equal to the fund value of these contracts. For Solvency II \\n\\ntechnical provisions, the present value of the margins is deducted from the fund value. \\n\\n \\nDifferences in technical provisions recognised in the IFRS and the Solvency II Balance sheets due to a different scope of consolidation caused \\nby NN Life Japan amounted to EUR -17,480 million as at 31 December 2018.  \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3  Valuation for \\n\\nE \\n\\nSolvency purposes \\n\\nValuation for Solvency purposes continued \\n \\n\\nMatching and volatility adjustment, transitional measures and transitional risk-free interest rate-term structure \\nQRT S.22.01.22 ‘Impact of long term guarantees and transitional measures’ in the Appendix provides the quantitative impact of excluding the so-\\ncalled Long Term Guarantee (‘LTG’) measures and Transitional measures from Own Funds and the SCR. QRT S.22.01.22 mandates disclosure of \\nthe quantitative impact of excluding: \\n∙ Transitional measures on technical provisions \\n∙ Transitional measures on interest rates \\n∙ Volatility adjustment \\n∙ Matching Adjustment \\n \\non: \\n∙ Technical provisions \\n∙ Basic Own funds \\n∙ Eligible Own funds to meet Solvency Capital Requirement \\n∙ Solvency Capital Requirement \\n \\nAll the elements of which the impact is excluded in this QRT are an integral part of the Solvency II framework. The resulting Own Funds and SCR \\nshould therefore not be seen as a replacement of, or alternative for, the Own Funds and SCR as determined in accordance with Solvency II. For \\nNN Group, the Volatility adjustment (‘VOLA’) is of significant relevance given its long-dated liability profile and its approach to match cash-flows \\nof these liabilities with corresponding fixed income instruments. Transitional measures in respect of technical provisions and interest rates are \\napplied by NN Group, but the impact thereof is less significant. NN Group does not apply the Matching Adjustment. \\n\\nTransitional on technical provisions \\nNN Group applies the transitional measures on technical provisions for its insurance businesses in Belgium and Spain. These transitional \\nmeasures resulted in a reduction of EUR 735 million in technical provisions, contributing EUR 551 million (after tax) to Basic Own Funds before \\ndeductions as at 31 December 2018. The impact on Basic Own Funds after deductions and on Eligible Group Own Funds is partly mitigated \\nbecause of the deduction of the excess non available Own Funds. Therefore the net impact on Eligible Own Funds is EUR 227 million. These \\ntransitional measures had no impact on the SCR as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nTransitional on the risk-free interest rates \\nNN Group applies the transitional measures on the risk-free interest rates for its insurance business in Greece. These transitional measures \\nresulted in a reduction of EUR 109 million in technical provisions as at 31 December 2018. The impact on Basic Own Funds after deductions and \\non Eligible Group Own Funds is partly mitigated because of higher excess non available Own Funds. Therefore the net impact on Eligible Own \\nFunds is EUR 67 million. The application of transitional measures on interest rates resulted in a decrease of the SCR of EUR 4 million. \\n\\nVolatility adjustment \\nNN Group applies the yield curve as published by EIOPA for the calculation of the technical provisions under Solvency II. In line with Solvency II \\nregulations, this yield curve includes a Volatility adjustment component. As at 31 December 2018, the level of the VOLA for the Euro currency \\nwas 24 bps (31 December 2017: 4 bps). The application of the VOLA resulted in a reduction of EUR 3,394 million in technical provisions, \\ncontributing EUR 2,674 million (after tax) to Basic Own Funds after deductions and Eligible Own Funds as at 31 December 2018.  \\n\\nIn the calculation of the SCR for the Partial Internal Model entities, NN Group assumes no change to the VOLA after a shock-event, but reflects \\nthe illiquidity of liabilities in the asset shocks to ensure appropriate solvency capital requirements. This VOLA approach is approved by DNB, in \\nparticular to ensure appropriate risk incentives on asset allocation decisions. NN Group also shocks all government bonds and its mortgage \\nportfolio in the calculation of spread risk capital requirements for the Partial Internal Model entities. Under the Standard Formula no capital is \\nrequired to be held against spread risk arising from these assets, whereas under the Partial Internal Model substantial capital is held against \\nthese risks. \\n\\nIf the VOLA would be excluded from the SCR calculation for Partial Internal Model entities, the spread risk on government bonds and mortgages \\nwould, in the opinion of NN Group, need to be adjusted accordingly. However, for the completion of QRT S.22.01.22 ‘Impact of long term \\nguarantees and transitional measures’ in the Appendix, NN Group is required to reflect only the impact of excluding the VOLA from Eligible Own \\nFunds and the SCR, without adjusting for the spread risk on government bonds and mortgages. \\n\\nThe impact of removing the VOLA from Own Funds increased in 2018 versus 2017 as the level of the VOLA in the yield curve as published by \\nEIOPA increased. The impact of removing the VOLA from the SCR increased in 2018 versus 2017 as the scope of the Partial Internal Model was \\nextended with the main Delta Lloyd entities in the Netherlands. \\n\\nD.3 Other liabilities \\nSubordinated debt, Debt securities issued and Other borrowed funds \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, subordinated debt, debt securities issued and other borrowed funds are reported at amortised cost. In the Solvency II \\nbalance sheet, these borrowings are reported at market value, excluding an adjustment for the change in NN Group’s own credit risk after initial \\nrecognition. In the Solvency II value, the change in the own credit risk is not taken into account. The Solvency II value of subordinated debt is \\ncalculated using discounted cash flows based on current interest rates and credit spreads at issue date. The Solvency II value of other \\nborrowed funds, is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using a current market interest rate and credit spreads at issue date. \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3  Valuation for \\n\\nE \\n\\nSolvency purposes \\n\\nValuation for Solvency purposes continued \\n \\n\\nValuation differences between IFRS and Solvency II for Subordinated debt of EUR 94 million and other borrowed funds of EUR 27 million \\nrepresent the difference between amortised cost and market value, excluding an own credit element. \\n\\nPresentation differences include the different presentation of accrued interest. Solvency II requires accrued interest to be presented as part of \\nthe interest-bearing liabilities (‘dirty market value’) and not separately as other liabilities as in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN \\nGroup (‘clean market value’). In addition to this presentation difference, subordinated debt presented as equity under IFRS is presented as \\nliability under Solvency II. Total presentation differences for subordinated debt amounted to EUR 1,890 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nDebt securities issued in IFRS is presented as other borrowed funds in Solvency II, causing a presentation difference of EUR -1,990 million. \\n\\nThe presentation differences in the other borrowed funds of EUR 6,088 million is for EUR 1,990 million transferred from Debt securities issued. \\nThe remaining part is the cash collateral amounts received for derivatives for EUR 4,085 million and accrued interest, both reported in IFRS \\nunder ‘Other liabilities’. \\n\\nDifferences due to a different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR -5,468 million for the other borrowed funds as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nCustomer deposits and other funds on deposit \\nNN Bank is the only group entity carrying Customer deposits. As NN Bank is reported as Other Financial Sector entities and thus not \\nconsolidated for Solvency II purposes, no Customer deposits and other funds on deposit are recognised in the Solvency II balance sheet. This \\nresults in consolidation difference amounted to EUR -14,729 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nNon Trading derivatives \\nMain difference is due to different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR -208 million which is related to NN Bank and NN Life Japan. \\n\\nLiabilities for employee benefits \\nNo significant liability for employee benefits exists in NN Group. \\n\\nDeferred tax liabilities \\nIn the Solvency II balance sheet, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised and valued in conformity with IFRS (reference is made to \\nsection D.1 ‘Assets’- Other assets). However, due to the differences in valuation of assets and liabilities as set out in sections D.1 ‘Assets’, D.2 \\n‘Technical provisions’ and D.3 ‘Other liabilities’, EUR -928 million lower deferred tax liabilities are recognised in the Solvency II balance sheet as \\nat 31 December 2018. Differences due to a different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR -592 million as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nOther liabilities \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, other liabilities are reported at the notional amount. In the Solvency II balance sheet, other liabilities are reported at \\nmarket value. \\n\\nPresentation differences amounted to EUR -4,279 million as at 31 December 2018 of which the main part (the cash collateral received) is \\ntransferred to Other borrowed funds. Presentation differences also include the different presentation of accrued interest. Solvency II requires \\naccrued interest to be presented as part of the interest bearing liability (‘dirty market value’) and not separately as other liabilities as in the 2018 \\nConsolidated annual accounts of NN Group (‘clean market value’). \\n\\nDifferences due to a different scope of consolidation amounted to EUR -1,578 million as at 31 December 2018.  \\n\\nContingent liabilities and provisions \\nPart of the other liabilities are the contingent liabilities and provisions. In the IFRS balance sheet, provisions are recognised when: \\n∙ An entity has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event \\n∙ It is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation \\n∙ A reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation \\n \\nIn the IFRS balance sheet, provisions are recognised for the amount representing the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the \\npresent obligation at the end of the reporting period. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the IFRS balance sheet. These are disclosed, \\nunless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. \\n\\nIn the Solvency II balance sheet, all material contingent liabilities are recognised as liabilities for the expected present value of future cash flows \\nrequired to settle the contingent liability over the lifetime of that contingent liability, using the basic risk-free interest rate term structure. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n\\n2 \\n\\n3  Valuation for \\n\\nE \\n\\nSolvency purposes \\n\\nValuation for Solvency purposes continued \\n \\n\\nValuation differences between IFRS and Solvency II for contingent liabilities and provisions represent: \\n∙ A recognition difference: contingent liabilities are not recognised in the IFRS balance sheet, but are recognised in the Solvency II balance \\n\\nsheet if the exposure can be reliably estimated \\n\\n∙ A measurement difference: provisions are measured in the IFRS balance sheet using the best estimate outcome (i.e. the full amount that \\n\\nmay be incurred), while Solvency II requires a provision for the probability weighted outcome (i.e. the probability multiplied by the impact of \\nthe differences as at 31 December 2018) \\n\\n \\nFor more details on other provisions and contingent liabilities, reference is made to Note 41 ‘Contingent liabilities and commitments’ and Note 42 \\n‘Legal proceedings’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group. \\n\\nThe valuation difference between IFRS and Solvency II for provisions and contingent liabilities had no material impact at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nLeasing \\nInformation on operating lease arrangements are recognised in Note 28 ‘Other operating expenses’ and Note 41 ‘Contingent liabilities and \\ncommitments’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group.

For more information on the expected profits in future premiums, reference is made to QRT S.23.01.22 ‘Own Funds’ as included in the \\nAppendix. \\n\\nOutflow of economic benefits \\nFor the expected timing of the outflows of economic benefits reference is made to Note 37 ‘Liabilities by maturity’ in the 2018 Consolidated \\nannual accounts of NN Group. Uncertainties surrounding the amount or timing of the outflows of economic benefits is described in the Liquidity \\nRisk paragraph in Note 50 ‘Risk management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group. The uncertainties in amount or timing of \\nother liability cash flows are low. Deviation risk was not taken into account in the valuation of the other liabilities. \\n\\nChanges during 2018 \\nNo significant changes were made to the recognition and valuation bases nor on estimations of the other liabilities during the reporting period. \\n\\nD.4 Alternative methods for valuation \\nDifferences within NN Group \\nThe bases, methods and main assumptions used at NN Group level for the valuation for Solvency II purposes does not differ materially from \\nthose used by any of its subsidiaries. \\n\\nAlternative valuation methods used \\nAlternative valuation methods are used by NN Group to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities if quoted market prices in active \\nmarkets are unavailable. Reference is made to Note 33 ‘Fair value of financial assets and liabilities’ and Note 34 ‘Fair value of non-financial \\nassets’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for more information on the valuation approaches used. \\n\\nD.5 Any other information \\nActive markets \\nInformation on the criteria used to assess whether markets are active is included in Note 1 ‘Accounting policies’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual \\naccounts of NN Group.

Capital Management \\nIntroduction \\nThis chapter of the SFCR contains information on the capital management of NN Group, including the reconciliation of IFRS equity to Solvency II \\nOwn Funds, NN Group’s Minimum Capital Requirement (‘MCR’) and detailed information on NN Group’s Partial Internal Model. \\n\\nE.1 Own funds \\nReference is made to Note 51 ‘Capital and liquidity management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for: \\n∙ The objectives, policies and processes employed by NN Group for managing its Own Funds, including information on the time horizon used \\n\\nfor business planning and on any material changes over the reporting period \\n\\n∙ The structure, amount and quality of Own Funds, including the extent to which each material own fund item is available and subordinated, \\n\\nas well as its duration and any other features that are relevant for assessing its quality \\n\\n∙ The amount of eligible Own Funds to cover the SCR, classified by tiers \\n \\nSolvency II Basic Own Funds represent the excess of assets over liabilities in the Solvency II balance sheet and subordinated liabilities. It \\ncomprises the following items: \\n∙ Paid-in ordinary share capital and the related share premium account \\n∙ The amount equal to the value of net deferred tax assets \\n∙ A reconciliation reserve. The purpose of the reconciliation reserve is to reconcile the value of the above items to the total amount of the \\n\\nexcess of assets over liabilities \\n∙ Paid-in subordinated liabilities \\n \\nNN Group did not have Ancillary Own Funds during 2018 or as at 31 December 2018. \\n\\nImpact of long term guarantees and transitional measures \\nThe quantification of the impact of a change to zero the volatility adjustment, transitional on technical provisions and transitional on interest \\nrates on NN Group\\'s financial position - represented by an adjustment on the amount of technical provisions, the SCR, the Basic Own Funds and \\nthe Eligible Own Funds is included in Section D.2 and QRT S.22.01.22 ‘Impact of long term guarantees and transitional measures’ in the Appendix. \\n\\nItems deducted from Own Funds \\nUnder Solvency II, Own Funds are reduced by ‘foreseeable dividends, distributions and charges’. This requirement is different from reporting \\nunder IFRS where dividends are deducted from equity (and a corresponding liability is recognised) when they are declared and share buy-backs \\nare deducted from equity (through ‘treasury shares held’) when these are executed. \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n29\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n3 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n4 \\nE \\n\\nCapital \\nmanagement \\n\\nCapital management continued \\n \\n\\nRecognition of ‘foreseeable dividends, distributions and charges’ under Solvency II are relevant in four different circumstances: \\n∙ Dividends (interim and final) \\n\\nUnder IFRS and Solvency II, dividends are deducted from equity when these are declared. Dividends are declared when these are \\napproved. Interim dividends are approved when decided by the Executive Board. Final dividends are to be approved by the General \\nmeeting of Shareholders. \\nIn addition, under Solvency II, proposed dividends that are not yet finally approved but form part of the appropriation of the net result for \\nthe year are foreseeable dividends as from the date the decision to distribute has been made by the Executive Board. If such decision is \\nmade after the balance sheet date but before the publication date, these are reflected as foreseeable dividends. Dividends that are \\napproved after the balance sheet date and relate to the new period/year (i.e. are not part of the appropriation of the result for the period), \\nare not reflected as foreseeable dividends at the reporting date. \\n\\n∙ Coupons on undated notes \\n\\nCertain funding transactions through undated perpetual notes with discretionary interest payments qualify as equity under IFRS. Under \\nIFRS, the coupons on these notes are deducted from equity when these become irrevocably due. This implies that coupons are deducted \\nfrom equity at the earlier of the following dates: \\n-  On the date of payment \\n-  On the date on which the otherwise discretionary payment becomes contractually required; this may be the case when the contract \\n\\nspecifies triggers for mandatory coupon payment, such as the declaration/payment of dividend on ordinary shares and/or a purchase of \\nown shares within a certain period \\n\\nUnder Solvency II, certain undated perpetual notes are recognised as Solvency capital. Coupon payments on such instruments are \\nconsidered to be distributions and fall under the requirements for ‘foreseeable dividends, distributions and charges’. Whilst a coupon may \\nbe discretionary (and, as such, there is no contractual requirement to pay), in normal circumstances it is expected that these will be paid. \\nAs such, these must be recognised as a foreseeable distribution on an accrual basis. If and when a trigger occurred under IFRS and the \\nfull annual coupon is already recognised under IFRS, the same amount is recognised under Solvency II. Consequently, the deduction from \\nSolvency II Own Funds is the higher of the accrued amount (if no liability is recognised under IFRS) and the full annual coupon (if \\nrecognised under IFRS). \\n\\n∙ Coupons on funding liabilities \\n\\n∙ Purchase of own shares \\n\\nUnder IFRS, coupons on funding classified as liabilities are recognised on an accrual basis. Under Solvency II, certain funding liabilities are \\nrecognised as capital (Tier 1 or Tier 2). Coupons payable on these instruments are in scope of ‘foreseeable dividends, distributions and \\ncharges’. Coupons are deducted from Own Funds on an accrual basis.  \\n\\nUnder IFRS, (re)purchased own shares (‘share buy backs’) are deducted from equity upon execution of the repurchase (the so-called \\n‘trade date’). In case of a share purchase programme that is executed over time, execution takes place at different points in time and, \\ntherefore, deduction from equity occurs at every specific execution date. \\nUnder Solvency II, when own shares are (re)purchased, these are considered to be distributions to shareholders. As such, they fall under \\nthe requirements for ‘foreseeable dividends, distributions and charges’. Purchases of own shares become foreseeable when the Executive \\nBoard has decided on a purchase. In case of a share purchase programme that is executed over time, but is decided upon as one \\nprogramme, the full (maximum) repurchase under the programme is deducted from Own Funds at the date the Executive Board approves \\nthe programme. \\nQuantitative explanation of the material differences between IFRS equity and excess assets over liabilities as calculated for solvency \\npurposes is provided further in this section and section D ‘Valuation for Solvency Purposes’. \\n\\n \\nForeseeable dividends, distributions and charges amount to EUR 541 million and include the proposed final 2018 dividend of EUR 415 million, and \\nthe accrued coupons on the eligible subordinated debt of EUR 126 million. \\n\\nAdditional ratios \\nNo additional ratios are disclosed in the Solvency and Financial Condition Report other than the ratios included in QRT S.23.01.22 ‘Own Funds’ \\nas included in the Appendix plus those that are included by reference into this report. \\n\\nAnalysis of significant changes in Own Funds \\nReference is made to Note 51 ‘Capital and liquidity management’ of the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for an analysis of \\nsignificant changes in Own Funds. \\n\\nThe principal loss-absorbency mechanism \\nDuring 2018, subordinated liabilities issued by NN Group and recognised as Tier 1 solvency capital had no principal loss-absorbency mechanism \\nin place. \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n30\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n3 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n4 \\nE \\n\\nCapital \\nmanagement

LAC TP is the part of the technical provisions that can be used to absorb \\n\\nsome of the SCR shock losses, as the expected future profit sharing to policyholders will be reduced if actual losses would arise. LAC TP is \\napplicable to insurance policies with discretionary profit sharing \\n\\n∙ Loss-absorbing capacity of deferred taxes (‘LAC DT’). NN Group’s total loss in a 1-in-200 adverse event would be offset by tax recoveries \\n\\nand these are recognised to the extent to be expected to be recoverable. The determination of LAC DT is significantly dependent on \\nvarious assumptions, such as capitalisation assumptions, the assumed investment returns and the projection period \\n\\n \\nReference is made to QRT S.25.02.22 ‘Solvency Capital Requirement’ in the Appendix. \\n\\nDeferred tax under Solvency II \\nThe total deferred tax amount in Solvency II arises from: \\n∙ Taxable or deductible temporary differences because the carrying amount of assets or liabilities in the balance sheet differs from the tax \\n\\nbase of those assets or liabilities. These differences multiplied by the tax rate are recognised as a net deferred tax liability or a net \\ndeferred tax asset (per legal entity) in the balance sheet. Reference is made to section D.1 ‘Assets’ for the deferred tax asset recognised in \\nthe Solvency II balance sheet \\n\\n∙ The LAC DT on the SCR \\n∙ Unused tax losses that are available for carry forward for tax purposes \\n \\nNot all valuation differences between the tax basis and Solvency II and SCR shocks will lead to deferred tax as certain elements are exempt for \\ntax. For example: valuation differences on certain equity securities and the equity shock in the SCR on these securities do not result in a deferred \\ntax effect when equity returns are exempt from tax. Therefore, these are excluded from the valuation differences and SCR amounts in order to \\narrive at the deferred tax balances for Solvency II. \\n\\ndeferred tax assets/liabilities from valuation differences between IFRS and tax basis (except for non-taxable items) \\ndeferred tax asset/liability in the IFRS balance sheet (deferred tax for IFRS) \\ndeferred tax assets/liabilities from valuation differences between Solvency II and IFRS (except for non-taxable items) \\ndeferred tax asset/liability in the Solvency II balance sheet (deferred tax for Own Funds) \\ndeferred tax on SCR (LAC DT on the SCR) (except for non-taxable items) \\ntotal deferred tax amount for Solvency II \\n\\nThe total deferred tax amount for Solvency II is therefore built up in a number of steps: \\n∙ deferred tax assets on unused tax losses \\n∙ +/- \\n∙ =  \\n∙ +/-  \\n∙ =  \\n∙ +  \\n∙ =  \\n \\nThe ‘total deferred tax amount for Solvency II’ represents the deferred tax position that would be reflected in a Solvency II balance sheet that is \\nfully shocked in line with the SCR shock. Any net deferred tax asset/benefit - whether for IFRS, Own Funds or SCR - must be tested for \\nrecoverability. The general guidance on assessing recoverability is summarised as follows: \\n∙ Tax assets can only be recognised when it is concluded that their recoverability is probable. This applies to both deferred tax assets from \\n\\ntiming differences, deferred tax assets from unused tax losses carried forward and the LAC DT on the SCR. \\n\\n∙ Deferred tax assets are recoverable when: \\n\\n-  There are sufficient deferred tax liabilities relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity. These deferred tax liabilities \\nmust be expected to reverse either in the same period as the tax asset or in periods into which a tax loss can be carried back or forward \\n\\n-  It is probable that the entity will have sufficient taxable profit relating to the same taxation authority and the same taxable entity in the \\nsame period as the reversal of the deductible temporary difference (or in the periods into which a tax loss arising from the deferred tax \\nasset can be carried back or forward) \\n\\n-  Tax planning opportunities are available \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n32\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n3 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n4 \\nE \\n\\nCapital \\nmanagement \\n\\nCapital management continued \\n \\n\\nDeferred taxes in the IFRS and Solvency II balance sheet are nominal, undiscounted, amounts. Therefore, recoverability testing also only \\nconsiders nominal, undiscounted, amounts. \\n\\nSpecific guidance applies under Solvency II in respect of item b. ‘Sufficient taxable profit’ as, different from IFRS, this refers to Solvency II based \\nprofits (before and after a shock event) and not to regular (IFRS-based) profits. \\n\\nIn order to assess the recoverability of deferred tax, the total deferred tax amount for Solvency II (i.e. deferred tax in the Solvency II balance \\nsheet plus the LAC DT on the SCR) must be equal to or lower than the total recoverable deferred tax amount in a Solvency II environment. \\n\\nThe recoverable amount must be assessed at the legal entity level and may not - except for the Solvency II balance sheet deferred tax asset \\nonly - include amounts from other entities in the Group, independent of existing fiscal unities or tax groups. While from a legal, tax and economic \\nperspective the recoverability would benefit from the existence of a fiscal unity, and therefore the benefit from a fiscal unity is ‘real’, the Q&As as \\npublished by DNB prohibits reflecting the benefit of a fiscal unity in supporting the LAC DT on the SCR. The fiscal unity may be reflected in \\nsupporting the deferred tax asset in the Solvency II balance sheet. \\n\\nAs the total deferred tax amount for Solvency II (i.e. the deferred tax asset that exists in a fully shocked SCR balance sheet) is the highest \\namount, it acts as starting point for the recoverability test. This total amount reflects the differences between the tax values and the Solvency II \\nvalues for all assets and liabilities and the tax benefit on the SCR. Only if the total deferred tax is non-recoverable, the recoverability of the \\ndeferred tax in Own Funds becomes separately relevant. \\n\\nIt is reasonable to assume that NN Group can continue as a going concern after the shock. The tax recoverability test of NN Group is performed \\non this basis. \\n\\nThe total recoverable deferred tax amount in a Solvency II environment may come from various sources and includes both recoverability from \\nitems that never impact taxable profits and reverse over time as well as sources of profits and losses that would emerge in a Solvency II \\nenvironment or a Solvency II environment after a SCR-type shock would have occurred. The recoverability is therefore based on an estimation \\nof the total taxable results (including both income and expenses) that is expected to arise in a Solvency II environment after the shock. The \\nsources of recoverability include all components of the estimated future taxable results, irrespective whether these are income (‘profit’) or \\nexpense (‘loss’). In this calculation the reduction of the ultimate Dutch corporate income tax rate from 25% to 20.5% is included, that was \\napproved in December 2018. \\n\\nThe following items may be included in determining the total recoverable deferred tax amount: \\n∙ The amount of the risk margin in the technical provision \\n∙ Taxable return on capital after the shock, after recapitalisation to 100% SCR if applicable, net of expected dividends \\n∙ Reversal of the net effects of the credit-spread shock \\n∙ Taxable part of investment spread in excess of interest accretion on liabilities and funding costs over their (expected average) remaining \\n\\nduration. \\n\\n∙ Profits from estimated new business \\n∙ Other taxable items \\n \\nNN Group has sufficient recoverable amounts to support the total deferred tax position recognised. \\n\\nThe net deferred tax asset is classified as Tier 3 capital. Tier 3 capital cannot exceed 15% of the Group Consolidated SCR.

A significant proportion of the NN Re risks are a \\n\\nshare of the NN Non-life risks where an Internal Model approach is applied. Variable Annuity risks are not adequately addressed by the \\nStandard Formula. The Internal Model captures the combined market risks and the dynamics of the hedging programmes more \\naccurately \\n\\n∙ In the case of Disability/Morbidity Risks, the product features and experience in the Dutch market are different from those in the wider \\n\\nEuropean market, e.g. greater emphasis is placed on claimants returning to work in the Netherlands \\n\\n∙ In the case of the non-life catastrophe windstorm risk in P&C products, the Internal Model better reflects the risk profile in the NN portfolio \\n\\nwhich differs due to the type of property \\n\\n∙ The Standard Formula diversification assumptions do not recognise all the diversification of risks that exist in the NN portfolios \\n∙ The Internal Model accounts for the volatility adjustment by means of an approach recognizing the illiquidity of liabilities in the asset \\n\\nshocks. Reference is made to section D.2 (in paragraph ‘Matching and volatility adjustment, transitional measures and transitional risk-\\nfree interest rate term structure’ on page 26) for further information on NN Group’s volatility adjustment \\n\\n \\nThere are no differences between the Internal Models used at individual undertaking level and the Internal Model used to calculate the Group \\nSCR. \\n\\nIn 2018, NN Group submitted a Major Model Change request to the DNB to expand its Partial Internal Model under Solvency II to include the \\nDelta Lloyd Life and Non-life entities in the Netherlands. The regulatory approval of the Partial Internal Model Major Model Change (PIM MMC) \\nwas received from the Dutch regulator (DNB) on 5 December 2018. The expanded approved Partial Internal Model is used to calculate \\nregulatory capital requirements effective 31 December 2018. NN Group applies the Standard Formula for the international insurance entities and \\nfor ABN AMRO insurance entities (ABN AMRO Life and ABN AMRO Non-Life). The risk profile of the Dutch Delta Lloyd Life and Non-Life entities \\nis broadly similar to that of the equivalent Dutch NN entities. NN Group therefore believes that the Internal Model as approved by the DNB is \\nmore appropriate for the Dutch Delta Lloyd entities than the Standard Formula, wherein certain areas as mentioned above are not captured \\nwell in terms of granularity and of supporting proper risk management. \\n\\nRisks covered by the Internal Model which are not – or differently - covered in the Standard Formula \\nRisk arises from the possibility that actual experience will adversely deviate from expectations, which results in economic losses for NN Group. In \\nthis respect, NN Group identified the following risk factors, and developed probability distributions for these various risk factors, as part of its \\nInternal Model, which leads to the Basic Solvency Capital requirement (‘BSCR’): \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n34\\n\\n\\x0cCapital management continued \\n \\n\\nA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n3 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n4 \\nE \\n\\nCapital \\nmanagement \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIn addition to the risks covered in the Standard Formula, the Internal Model includes the following risks: \\n∙ Inflation risk is defined as the risk associated with adverse changes in both realised and future expected inflation rates \\n∙ Equity implied volatility refers to the possibility of adverse changes in Solvency II Own Funds due to adverse changes in the level of equity \\n\\n∙ Interest rate implied volatility refers to the possibility of adverse changes in Solvency II Own Funds due to adverse changes in the level of \\n\\n∙ Foreign Exchange implied volatility refers to the possibility of adverse changes in Solvency II Own Funds due to adverse changes in the \\n\\nimplied volatilities \\n\\ninterest rate implied volatilities \\n\\nlevel of FX implied volatilities \\n\\n∙ Basis risk is the risk that occurs if the underlying asset or liability behaves differently than the underlying hedge instrument \\n∙ Continuation risk refers to political, country or legal risk \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n35\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n3 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n4 \\nE \\n\\nCapital \\nmanagement \\n\\nCapital management continued \\n \\n\\nThe most important differences between Internal Model and Standard Formula in covered risk factors are: \\n∙ Interest Rate Risk: \\n\\n-  The Internal Model incorporates several shocks, including non-parallel ones, to the curve instead of only two parallel shocks used in the \\n\\nStandard Formula \\n\\n-  The Internal Model uses absolute shocks, while the Standard Formula applies relative shocks to the base curves \\n-  The Internal Model allows for shocking negative interest rates, whereas the Standard Formula does not \\n-  In the Internal Model, first, the shock is applied to the interest rates and then the resulting rates are extrapolated to the Ultimate Forward \\n\\nrate. In the Standard Model the interest rates are first extrapolated to the Ultimate Forward rate and afterwards the shock is applied \\n\\n-  In the internal model interest rates converge to the UFR after shock and thereby follow the dynamics of the balance sheet, whereas in the \\n\\nStandard Formula there is no convergence to the UFR after shock \\n\\n-  Level of shocks differs mainly because it is calibrated to the equity portfolio of NN Group \\n\\n-  Shocks in the Internal Model apply to all fixed income assets, whereas the Standard Formula does not apply shocks to the bonds issued by \\n\\n∙ Equity Risk: \\n\\n∙ Credit Spread Risk: \\n\\ncountries which are EU members \\n\\n∙ Real Estate Risk: \\n\\n-  Shock applied in the Standard Formula is calibrated to historical prices observed in the UK property market, which is less representative for \\n\\nNN Group’s portfolio, while the shock in the Internal Model is calibrated to actual exposures of NN Group \\n\\n-  Counterparty Default Risk module in the Standard Formula includes shocks applied to mortgage exposure, which are included under the \\n\\n∙ Counterparty Default Risk: \\n\\nCredit Spread module in the Internal Model \\n∙ Diversification within the Market Risk module: \\n\\n-  The Internal Model assumes significant diversification between Interest Rate risk, on the one hand, and Credit Spread and Equity risks, on \\n\\nthe other. Under the Standard Formula, diversification between these risks is different \\n\\n∙ Life Risk: \\n\\n-  Under the Internal Model, longevity risk (i.e. longevity trend uncertainty) is based on a multiyear model, whereas under the Standard \\n\\nFormula the longevity risk is estimated by permanently decreasing all mortality rates by the same fixed percentage \\n\\n \\nStructure of the Partial Internal Model \\nThe BSCR in the Partial Internal Model is calculated as follows: the aggregate total BSCR of Internal Model entities (namely NN Life, Delta Lloyd \\nLife, NN Non-Life, Delta Lloyd Non-Life, NN Re and Movir) is combined with the aggregate total BSCR of the Standard Formula entities \\n(international businesses and ABN AMRO insurance entities) using a correlated sum - recognising a Solvency II regulation based diversification \\nbetween the Internal Model and Standard Formula entities. At a lower level, diversification between the Internal Model entities is based on \\nInternal Model, and between the Standard Formula entities is based on Standard Formula. \\n\\nCapital requirements for operational risk are calculated in NN Group’s entities based on the Standard Formula, and added to the combined \\nBSCR. \\n\\nNext, loss absorption effects from technical provisions and taxes are included. Finally, capital requirements for non-modelled entities are added. \\n\\nThe table below shows the results for the steps described above. \\n\\nSCR \\nIn EUR million \\nInternal Model entities \\nStandard Formula entities \\nDiversification \\nPartial Internal Model BSCR \\n \\nOperational Risk \\nCapital add-on \\nLoss-Absorbing Capacity of Technical Provisions \\nLoss-Absorbing Capacity of Deferred Taxes \\nNon-modelled Solvency II Entities \\nSolvency II entities \\n \\nNon-Solvency II entities \\nTotal SCR \\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n \\n\\n2018 \\n6,435 \\n1,408 \\n-269 \\n7,574 \\n \\n659 \\n0 \\n-102 \\n-1,456 \\n92 \\n6,767 \\n \\n507 \\n7,274 \\n \\n\\n2017 \\n4,870 \\n3,535 \\n-82 \\n8,323 \\n \\n677 \\n44 \\n-131 \\n-1,788 \\n105 \\n7,230 \\n \\n501 \\n7,731 \\n \\n\\n36\\n\\n\\x0cA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n3 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n4 \\nE \\n\\nCapital \\nmanagement \\n\\nCapital management continued \\n \\n\\nThe nature and appropriateness of the data used in the Internal Model \\nMarket data is collected from pre-defined external data sources. The market data methodologies are based on the following key principles: \\n∙ All relevant market data must be used when it is available and is of sufficient quality, i.e. data derived from deep, liquid and transparent \\n\\n(‘DLT’) markets; for most of the market risk models NN Group uses standard well established market data sources, e.g. Bloomberg \\n∙ The market data used should be of sufficient quality; e.g. for most of the market risk models standard well established market data \\n\\nsources are used, e.g. Bloomberg. The data is analysed for correctness as part of the calibration process \\n\\n∙ From the last observable liquid market data point, extrapolation methods must be used to complete the data set \\n∙ Extrapolated market data should \\n\\n-  Be free of arbitrage \\n-  Be based on sound theoretical assumptions and/or expert judgment \\n-  Follow a smooth path from the entry point to the unconditional long-term level \\n\\n∙ Estimates of ultimate long-term rates or levels should be stable over time, and only change because of changes in long-term expectations \\n \\nQualitative and quantitative information on the material sources of group diversification effects \\nThe material group diversification effects arise from: \\n∙ Diversification within market risk module of EUR 6,855 million as at 31 December 2018 including diversification effects between interest \\n\\nrate risk, on the one hand, and credit spread and equity risk, on the other \\n\\n∙ Diversification between market risk and non-market risk of EUR 2,367 million as at 31 December 2018 \\n \\nDifferences between Internal Model used at individual undertaking level and at the group level \\nThere are no differences between any Internal Models used locally and at the Group level. The Group uses central models for market risk and \\ncounterparty default risk, which are also applied by all entities using Internal Models. \\n\\nEntities in the scope of the Internal Model have their specific models for non-market risk, which are then aggregated at the Group level for the \\nGroup SCR calculation. \\n\\nThe use of the Internal Model \\nThe Internal Model allows NN Group to treat different risk management activities in a consistent way: \\n∙ The model provides a framework which is consistent across risk types, businesses and the key uses such as market valuation, \\n\\ncapitalisation, product pricing, investments, monitoring of risk appetite and risk mitigation/transfer \\n\\n∙ The model facilitates adequate risk management at all levels of the organisation and provides a framework to measure, monitor and \\n\\nmanage risks versus NN Group’s risk appetite \\n\\n∙ The model allows NN Group to manage risk in many different ways, e.g.: \\n\\n-  Manage individual risk types at a much more granular approach, i.e. a stochastic (loss distribution) approach \\n-  Manage volatility in a stochastic rather than deterministic approach \\n-  Supports valuation, scenario - and stress analysis by running scenarios in a simple way using replicating portfolios \\n\\n∙ The model allows NN Group to proactively define its risk measurement and management approach rather than awaiting (generic) industry \\n\\nchanges to the Standard Formula \\n\\n \\nThe Internal Model is used for different purposes (NN Group uses the Internal Model to measure the Own Funds at Risk (or Regulatory Capital at \\nRisk) across its entities). Reference is made to Note 50 ‘Risk Management’ in the 2018 Consolidated annual accounts of NN Group for the \\ndifferences vs. the model used to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement). It is used to measure and manage the risks at all levels within the \\ncompany, thus covering the entire loss distribution. This information is not only used to determine the SCR to cover tail risks. It is also used for, \\namongst others, wider risk management, capital management and business decisions such as product pricing and asset allocation. \\n\\n \\n\\nNN Group N.V. \\n2018 Solvency and Financial Condition Report \\n\\n37\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cCapital management continued \\n \\n\\nThe following diagram provides an overview of the key uses of the Internal Model. \\n\\nA \\n\\n1 \\nB  C  D \\n3 \\n\\n2 \\n\\n4 \\nE \\n\\nCapital \\nmanagement \\n\\n \\n\\nThe methods used in the Internal Model for the calculation of the probability distribution forecast and the Solvency Capital Requirement \\nFor the market risk models the Normal Inverse Gaussian (‘NIG’) distribution is mostly used.
